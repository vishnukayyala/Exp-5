# Exp - 5 STUDENT ENROLLMENT SYSTEM

# AIM : To study the problem statement, SRS document and draw all the UML diagrams of a Student Enrollment Management System.

# SRS (Procedure) :

1. Step 1 - Open StarUML and start a new project.
2. Step 2 - Name the project based on the system (e.g., ATM, Library).
3. Step 3 - Identify actors and use cases from the system requirements.
4. Step 4 - Choose and draw diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, etc.).
5. Step 5 - Add elements using the toolbox and connect them properly.
6. Step 6 - Label all components clearly and meaningfully.
7. Step 7 - Save and export diagrams as images or PDF.
